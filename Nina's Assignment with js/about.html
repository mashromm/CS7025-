                    <p>Throw Away </p>
                    <p>Some people will throw away clothes as a last resort.
                    They will only throw away clothes if they are severely 
                    damaged or have stains that cannot be removed. </p>
                    <p>However, other people will throw away clothes that 
                        have only been worn for one or two years (only if they 
                        are of good quality) because their clothes cannot keep 
                        up with the trend or their wardrobe is not large enough 
                        to accommodate too many clothes.</p>

                    <p>Selling</p>
                    <p>For many people, selling unused clothing is a cost-effective option 
                        because it reduces their own expenses and is also very 
                        environmentally friendly. However, many platforms only accept 
                        branded clothes, and it is difficult to distinguish the authenticity 
                        of the clothes on the platform.</p>
                    <p>Many people are also willing to buy second-hand clothes 
                        because they can find cheap, cost-effective clothes with good 
                        designs. But some people report that they are worried about 
                        hygiene issues, and some second-hand clothes are more expensive 
                        than ordinary clothes.</p>

        <h1>What do I do</h1>
        <p>I want to create a second-hand clothing auction website to reduce resource waste and greenhouse gas
            emissions caused by fast fashion. I drafted a solution specifically for hoarding clothes without 
           monetary transactions: Bidders could match certain clothing with AR and publish it on the platform.
            The auctioneers then select their favorite design and send the clothing to the designer.</p>
